# EA Turner Challenge | NodeJS MongoDB solution - Nelson Omuto #

This is a simple jquerymobile SPA front end using handlebars,
the http api is based on nodejs and mongodb.

I added two filters for the user to filter the results of their search based on genre and release years.
The filters are dropdowns whose values although hardcoded in this example,
should ideally come from a service call.
